    <p>Profile statement: I am a seasoned Chartered Accountant (SA), Finance and Project management professional with extensive experience in the financial services and manufacturing industry. I have a passion for education and working with young professionals, and am also a qualified SAICA accredited Assessor. After a successful corporate career, I became disabled due to long term illness, which condition was exacerbated due long COVID 19, and was therefore unable to participate in any meaningful capacity in the workforce and economy since 2019. However, due to remission, I am now looking forward to re-enter the workforce after the lengthy hiatus, albeit in the capacity of remote work, part-time and reduced hours opportunities. I currently have a home office setup and am available immediately.</p>
